astroTools INSTALL


You can use CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is open-source software, 
and can be downloaded for free from http://www.cmake.org/.  You will also need a 
Fortran compiler, e.g. gfortran: https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/  Lastly, you'll need 
a version of libSUFR (http://libsufr.sf.net) and libTheSky (http://libthesky.sf.net) 
installed.


To compile and install the code (in the CMake default directory /usr/local/), 
from the main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install the code in a specific directory, e.g. the Linux default /usr/, 
   replace the "cmake .." step above with:

 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..

This will install binaries in /usr/bin/, libraries in /usr/lib/, etc.


If you're installing the code somewhere in your home directory, you can leave out
   the sudo command in the last step:

 $ make install


To force CMake to compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line 
   with e.g. FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the last step
   ((sudo) make install)
