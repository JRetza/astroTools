.SH NAME
astroTools \- command-line tools for astronomy and astrophysics, written in Fortran

.SH DESCRIPTION

The package astroTools provides assorted command-line tools for astronomy and 
astrophysics, written in Fortran. The package is currently in the alpha stage; 
many programs sit around on my computer, waiting to be gathered, tidied up and 
added â€” stay tuned.  They can be used under the 
conditions of version 3 of the GPL.  To download the astroTools package, read the 
code documentation, or to contact the developer, see: 
\fBhttp://astrotools.sourceforge.net\fP\&.
